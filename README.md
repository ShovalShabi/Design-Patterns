# Design-Patterns
Final project in course Design Patterns conducted in Java for the buissenes logic, JavaFX for GUI and MySQL for designing the DB.

**Project vision:**
An application that helps drivers to find a nearby parking spot which is free.
The application will be a form of social media, in order to establish a community of drivers that helps each other, each user will be able to find an available parking spots in real time.

**Application fuctionality:**
-Users can send reports to other users, providing inforamtion on parking spots status (available,taken,blocked,etc..), also the users can like other users reports.
-The main assumption of the project is that there is a single parking spot for each address or coordinate (to simplify the idea of the project).
-In addition the project has the capabillities of single-user so I decided to make every non-logged user to a bot that will send and like reports and will be dynmically located, the bot will switch parking spots in every permanent time.
